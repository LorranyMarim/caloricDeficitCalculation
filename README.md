The purpose of this project is to estimate caloric loss based on weight, height, age, sex, and physical activity profile.

The program provides estimates for the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), which is the number of calories the body requires to maintain vital functions; the Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE), which includes calories burned considering the physical activity profile; and the Caloric Deficit, which calculates the calories to be burned to achieve an approximate weight loss of 0.5 kg per week.

The application also provides the time and pace/load of activities, such as running and strength training, required to reach the specified caloric deficit.

The program is in Portuguese-BR.
